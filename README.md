# NamasteTechnologies_DataChallenge

This project was completed as a response to a data challenge issued by Namaste Technologies. You will find all my work in this repository.

The files that are included are as follows;
	
	1. Task1.ipynb : This Jupyter Notebook follows the instructions given for Task 1. The objective of this notebook is to load the JSON data and merge the appropriate Exchange Rate based on the date using an API.
	2. Task2.ipynb : This Jupyter Notebook follows the instructions given for Task 2. The main goal of this notebook was to connect to my local SQLite and create tables and upload the data using Python's sqlite3 package.
	3. Namaste_Task.db : This is the final result after completing the Task 2 notebook. This has all the data uploaded into a relational database.
	4. Task1.csv : This is the data exported from Task 1. This was used to look at the data and use as a reference in case any problems came up.
	5. Task3.twb : The final step which was to create a Tableau dashboard based on all the previous tasks. The dashboard has also been uploaded onto the Tableau Public domain.
